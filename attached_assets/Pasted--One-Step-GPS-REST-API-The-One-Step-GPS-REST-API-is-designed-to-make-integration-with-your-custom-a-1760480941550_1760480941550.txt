One Step GPS REST API

The One Step GPS REST API is designed to make integration with your custom application simple and fast.

For a basic use case of the One Step REST API, please take a look at the API User Guide.
Please Note: This API is currently under development and subject to change. Effort will be made to keep the URLs, parameters, and fields documented below functioning as documented on a best-effort basis. The result of these API calls may also contain additional undocumented fields, likely to change as development continues. Calls and data which become stable will be added to the documentation to express the intention to support this feature moving forward.
Getting Started
Endpoint

The REST API is accessed over HTTPS and all endpoints have this prefix: https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/
Authentication

To use the One Step GPS REST API you will need an API key. API keys can be obtained upon request. Please email integration@onestepgps.com and include a brief description of your intended use of the API.

Important Note: API keys should be kept secure and only used on trusted machines. All calls are made over HTTPS. Do not provide your API key to anyone who should not have full access to your One Step GPS account. Do not expose API keys in the source code of public web pages.

API keys shown below are for demonstration purposes only, use your own API key when testing/developing.

Once an API key is obtained you can use it to authenticate your requests using the Authorization HTTP request header, like so:

GET /v3/api/public/device-info HTTP/1.1
Host: track.onestepgps.com
Authorization: Bearer V8rjndh7Kv8b5DOvYzdJuhXJLiuDZdgywDEiWGrMECg

Or you can provide it as the api-key query parameter:

https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/device-info?lat_lng=1&api-key=V8rjndh7Kv8b5DOvYzdJuhXJLiuDZdgywDEiWGrMECg
CURL Example

The examples below use curl. If you are using Mac or Linux you most likely already have this tool installed. For Windows it can be downloaded here. The API key should be included in the Authorization header preceded by "Bearer ".

To get a list of devices associated with your user account (and API key) with curl is as simple as:

curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer V8rjndh7Kv8b5DOvYzdJuhXJLiuDZdgywDEiWGrMECg' https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/device-info?lat_lng=1

You can alternatively provide the API key with the api-key query parameter. For example:

 curl 'https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/device-info?lat_lng=1&api-key=<your-api-key>'

Note: For ease of development, if you are logged in the API key can be omitted from requests.
API Calls

The rest of this document shows the available calls. For simple use cases to display devices and their current/recent history, the usual pattern is to search the devices (/v3/api/public/device-info) and then query for individual points (/v3/api/public/device-point).
Times

All times are sent and received in RFC3339 format (which includes the timezone offset). For example: 2020-01-02T10:11:12.321-07:00 means 2 Jan 2020 10:11am and 12.321 seconds with an offset of -7 hours from UTC. For UTC times, Z can be substituted for the time zone, e.g. this is the same exact moment in time in UTC: 2020-01-02T17:11:12.321Z The fractional seconds portion is optional when sending times. Times received from the API may or may not have fractional seconds, depending on the context. Any standard RFC3339 time formatter and parser will work correctly with the API.
Advanced Usage and Integration

The REST API described here is intended to work for the most common integration patterns. API keys are issued with an hourly request limit that should be suitable for most needs.

If you find something in this API doesn't suite your needs, contact us at integration@onestepgps.com and let us know. We'll do our best to accommodate your custom integration request.

DevicePoint
DevicePoint - Search Device Points

Retrieve a list of individual points associated with a device. Each active device connected to a running vehicle transmits a new point approximately every minute (or based on your usage plan's configured interval). This endpoint can be used to fetch historical data points, with all timestamps provided in RFC3339 format (e.g., 2018-08-27T05:34:15Z).

Use either dt_server_from and dt_server_to or dt_tracker_from and dt_tracker_to to specify the desired time range. If the to parameter is omitted, it defaults to "now". The from parameter must be earlier than the to parameter.

To fetch all new records since your last request, set dt_server_from to the time of your previous call. This approach ensures you receive any new data points, including those that might have been delayed due to connectivity issues. Refer to the descriptions of dt_server and dt_tracker fields below for further details.

For more information on state and device attributes (e.g., speed, battery level, odometer), see the Device Point documentation.

get

/v3/api/public/device-point

query
Field 	Type 	Description
device_id 	String 	

Unique identifier of the device to return point for. Either this or device_id_list is required.
device_id_list 	String 	

Can be provided multiple times, one for each device (and instead of device_id) to search multiple devices. The return value will be wrapped in a device_list array which contains one result for each device searched.
limit 	Integer 	

The maximum number of records to return. Default is 100. Value may not exceed 5000.
offset 	Integer 	

The offset into the results from which to start returning records. Default is 0. Value of offset+limit must not exceed 5000.
return_count 	Boolean 	

Pass true to request that the count be returned in the output.
return_deleted 	Boolean 	

pass true to request count of deleted points
dt_server_from 	Time 	

Filter by server time starting from this moment (inclusive).
dt_server_to 	Time 	

Filter by server time up to this moment (exclusive, i.e. everything up to but not including this exact moment).
dt_tracker_from 	Time 	

Filter by tracker device time starting from this moment (inclusive).
dt_tracker_to 	Time 	

Filter by tracker device time up to this moment (exclusive, i.e. everything up to but not including this exact moment).
sort 	String 	

The order to use when searching and returning results. If provided must be one of the following: "sequence,desc" (default) or "sequence" (ascending)

    Request-Example:

https://track.onestepgps.com/v3/api/public/device-point?device_id=6ceQekmYQ99YOF81f0B-0V&dt_server_from=2018-09-27T00:00:00.0Z

Result Object
Field 	Type 	Description
result_length 	Integer 	

Length of result_list.
count 	Integer 	

Total length of all available results up to 5000 and queries returning more than this will need to be narrowed in order to retrieve all results. Up to this maximum, you can use the limit and offset parameters to retrieve records one "page" at a time. Will only be provided if you specify return_count in the request.
result_list 	Array 	

List of device points.
Result List Item
Field 	Type 	Description
device_id 	String 	

The unique ID of the device
dt_server 	Time 	

The time this point was received by the OneStepGPS servers. Note that while is normally within a few seconds from the value of dt_tracker, it may be considerably longer if the device was unable to connect to the cellular network for a period of time.
dt_tracker 	Time 	

The time the device recorded its location, regardless of when this information was relayed to our servers.
lat 	Number 	

Device latitude
lng 	Number 	

Device longitude

Report - Search Report Generation Records

Search/List Report Generated. A "Report Generated" is the output of running a "Report Scheduled" and includes the result of whatever calculations were involved with the report. This call and others return data describing the report, and the report contents themselves are available via the Export Report Generated call.

To paginate, use Limit to set how many records you want returned at a time, then increase the Offset in intervals each time. It's recommended to increase the Offset by the same value as the Limit.

For example: You want to paginate in intervals of 10, so you would set the Limit to 10, and the Offset to 0. Then you would increase the Offset by the same value as the Limit, which in this case the Offset would become 10 to view the 2nd set of records. And to view the 3rd set of records, you would increment the Offset by 10 again and the Offset would become 20.

ReportScheduled
ReportScheduled - Create Scheduled Report

Create a Scheduled Report that periodically generates Reports.

For information regarding the report_spec, refer to the "Create Report" section above.

When creating a Scheduled Report with the all_devices, all_device_groups or all_assignees flag set to true, the Scheduled Report will acknowledge any additions or removeals to the Devices, Device Groups or Assignees the User has access to. These changes will take effect the next time the Scheduled Report creates a Generated Report.

Due to the complexity of creating a Scheduled Report, we recommend reading an in-depth explanation of how to set it up here.

ReportScheduled - Search Scheduled Report

Searches and returns a list of Scheduled Reports using specificed filters.

To paginate, use Limit to set how many records you want returned at a time, then increase the Offset in intervals each time. It's recommended to increase the Offset by the same value as the Limit.

For example: You want to paginate in intervals of 10, so you would set the Limit to 10, and the Offset to 0. Then you would increase the Offset by the same value as the Limit, which in this case the Offset would become 10 to view the 2nd set of records. And to view the 3rd set of records, you would increment the Offset by 10 again and the Offset would become 20.
